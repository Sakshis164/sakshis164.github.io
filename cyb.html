                <h2>Cyber security</h2>
                <p>Center for Excellence in Cyber Security and IoT at NMIT has been created with the objective of catalyzing innovation, entrepreneurship and capability building in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The Motto is to discover the best practices, define standards and create secure products that address the threats to security of digital assets and ensures privacy in this interconnected world. The rapid progress in the development of connected intelligent units (Internet of Things) has made its impact in almost every walk of life. This lab also provide insight into this emerging technology of Internet of Things through democratization of Innovation, Standardization, Realization of prototype, products before deployment of the IoT devices in the public domain/ infrastructure and support initiatives on development of IoT solutions for specific needs in areas like water management, energy management, agriculture, health, security, privacy of data etc. Given such wide spread use of IOT devices unless sufficient caution is exercised during their development they are likely to create attack surfaces for the unscrupulous to penetrate the network through these devices and take control of it resulting in possibly significant financial losses and compromise of strategic infrastructure. The collaboration with SUBEX and the Institution focuses on training the students in the art and science of identifying attacks on the network assets and learning about counter-attacking and damage mitigation techniques. The students will learn techniques useful for effectively managing the entire lifecycle of working with cyber sandboxes with orchestration that supports automated setup, provisioning, teardown, monitoring, and scaling. This will pave the way for successful projects. The objective is to impart knowledge and create awareness on the important facets of different technologies, highlighting the current trends and future directions in the multidisciplinary domains. Facilities made available in the SUBEX COE has enabled the students and faculty members to engage themselves in many projects which have resulted in satisfactory outcomes. .
